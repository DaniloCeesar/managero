## 📚 Project overview

The aim of Manaĝero (in Esperanto: *manager*) is to integrate useful features to boost user productivity, to be more focused and more productive, including task manager, calendar and events notifications.

There are other open and closed-source applications that provide those same features, but only a few include both a nice User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) as the Manaĝero does.

Also, Manaĝero differentiates itself from similar projects by using modern technologies. Our source code was made using: the utility-first CSS framework [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss); and the JavaScript framework [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine).
